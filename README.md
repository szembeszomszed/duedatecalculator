# duedatecalculator
The program calculates the due date of an issue reported. 
The report issue date and the turnaround time can be provided in the main method as per the examples (no user interface has been created).
The report issue date must be provided in the given format otherwise the program will use the current date.
If the report issue date or the current date (see above) is outside working hours (9-5) or at weekend the program terminates with an exception. 
The program accepts 1 hour turnaround time as minimum. Values below this amount are adjusted to the minimum acceptable amount.

I have very limited experience with writing tests so I didn't perform this part of the exercise. Unfortunately, writing tests has not been part of the scope in any of my previous/current jobs. So this is clearly something I need to and want to learn.
